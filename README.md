# QuickSnap

## A replica of instagram

This is my final project for The Odin Project

Notes about:

- image compression
- custom hooks
- tailwind
- testing coverage
- firestore data modelling (for a follower/following relationship)
- Algolia for search to find users. And maybe hashtags?
- Handling logic to delete a user or a post (and related hearts/saves/comments/storage)
- If a user has nothing in their own feed, populate it with recent posts from "famous" accounts
